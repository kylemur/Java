# Overview

I have experience with C, C++, and C#, so I wanted to learn Java because it is in the same family.

This Java Paint program is a GUI that allows the user to draw lines, shapes, tubes, use different colors, use an eraser, and change the background color. 
All the code is part of one base class (MainWindow) and a derived class (DrawingPanel).

I made a paint program because I do not have very much experience with GUIs and I want to broaden my programming knowledge. My current GUI experience is from making a couple programs with Python that use a GUI and other programs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (basically making a GUI).

# Development Environment

I downloaded Java and integrated it into VS Code by adding the reccomended extensions. Without the extensions, I probably would have used Eclipse.
I went through the W3Schools tutorial and a YouTube tutorial by Telusko.
I also used Copilot to explain syntax errors and answer questions like, "What is TreeSet?"

Imported some of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), including javax.swing. 
Imported from Abstract Window Toolkit (java.awt) for event handling like mouse clicks, drags, and releases.

# Future Work

- Make the shape tools create just one shape from the mouse click coordinates to the mouse release.
- Stop the drop-down menu from erasing.
- Create Save and Load features, use TreeSet to organize the file name alphabetically.
- Add a Fill feature that will color everything inside a shape.
