# Overview

{Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I have experience with C, C++, and C#, so I wanted to learn Java because it is in the same family.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I made a paint program because I do not have very much experience with GUIs and I want to broaden my programming knowledge. My current GUI experience is from making a couple programs with Python that use a GUI and other programs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (basically making a GUI).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
